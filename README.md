# Swat Dining Object
Allows users to get information in a better JSON format than the one currently given by Swarthmore's Dining API. All menu items will be turned into individual objects with properties including allergy tags, dietary restrictions, menu type, lunch and dinner, etc. Users will be able to query a menu object which can return menu information from each individual dining option. Each menu will have each individual food option separated an object of its own, complete with dietary tag information.
This allows users to sort, filter, and compile lists of menu items based on dining location, dietary restrictions, etc.

Currently the library is only limited to the current and next day's menu items.
